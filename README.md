# About the project
This project was developped as part of my Algorithmic Techniques for AI course over the Fall 2023 semester along with my teammate.

The aim of this project was to create an AI that could play connect-4 using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. The algorithm is given a time limit and/or a depth limit, based on which it can make a decision. The depth limit is how many moves ahead should it be predicting. The AI can also have different traits to guide its behaviour. All of these feaures can be toggled according to user preference.  

In the demo video, I go over the specifics of the code and some interesting 'tricks' I learnt while working on this project.
